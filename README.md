# Motivation

I need some clean Ticket/Receipt View view for my Flutter application.

# Getting started

## Installing
Add this to your package's pubspec.yaml file:

This library is posted in pub.dev

#### pubspec.yaml
```dart
dependencies:  
	sks_ticket_view: ^1.0.0
```

# Usage

After Importing this library, you can directly use this view in your Widget tree

```dart
import 'package:ticketview/ticketview.dart';
```

Default Ticket View
```dart
TicketView(
        child: Container(),
    )
```

Customized Receipt View

```Dart
SKSTicketView(
      backgroundPadding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 0, horizontal: 20),
      backgroundColor: Color(0xFF8F1299),
      contentPadding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 24, horizontal: 0),
      drawArc: false,
      triangleAxis: Axis.vertical,
      borderRadius: 6,
      drawDivider: true,
      trianglePos: .5,
      child: Container(),
    )
```


# Customization
  Depending on your view you may want to tweak the UI. For now you can these custom attributes

  | Property | Type | Description |
  |----------|------|-------------|
  | `backgroundColor` | Color | Background card color for TicketView |
  | `contentBackgroundColor` | Color | Content card color for TicketView |
